# checkboxes

## Description

An example of styled checked boxes. The checkbox is hidden and the associated label is styled. When the label is clicked it sets the check on the checkbox to be true. A keyframe animation is played on a ball shaped div inside the label that shows the checkbox to be checked or unchecked. All three checkboxes cannot be checked at the same time (two at most can be checked). A js function is used to create the logic for the program
